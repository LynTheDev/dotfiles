# I3 Dotfiles

# NOTE:
Please keep in mind that this was made for myself. I do not know how your pc will react to this.

# Setup:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LynTheDev/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles/.config/i3/scripts
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
```
Now, you must copy the configs to your .config directory.

```bash
    cd /path/to/dotfiles/.config
    cp -r * ~/.config
```

Done, Boot into the i3 install and get yourself a nice gtk theme.
Enjoy~
